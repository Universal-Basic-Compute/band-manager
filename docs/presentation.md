## Product Overview

Unlike traditional music production tools or games, Band Manager combines creative expression with advanced AI to generate authentic music that reflects your artistic vision. Create songs you can actually listen to, build albums you can share, and watch your virtual band grow through simulated performances and fan interactions.
